2. Click the **Lock button** (🔒 orange)
3. **Verify**:
   - Lock button changes to green Unlock (🔓)
   - "Locked" badge appears next to user name
   - Edit button becomes grayed out
   - Clicking edit button does nothing
   - Console shows: `🔒 User locked: USER000...`

### Step 3: Unlock User

2. **Verify**:
   - Unlock button changes back to orange Lock (🔒)
   - "Locked" badge disappears

   - Console shows: `🔓 User unlocked: USER000...`

### Step 4: Edit User
1. Make sure user is **unlocked**
2. Click the **Edit button** (pencil icon)
3. **Verify**:
   - Dialog opens with "Edit User" title
   - All fields are pre-filled with current data
   - Console shows: `🔧 Opening edit dialog for user: {...}`

### Step 5: Modify User Data
1. Change the **Name** field (e.g., add "- EDITED" to the name)
2. Change the **Hourly Rate** (e.g., from 120 to 150)

   - User list refreshes
   - Updated data appears in the list
   - Console shows: `✅ User updated successfully`

### Step 7: Verify Database Update
1. Refresh the page
2. Check if the edited user still shows updated values
3. This confirms data was saved to database

### Step 8: Test Cancel
1. Click Edit on another user
2. Make some changes
3. Click **"Cancel"** button
4. **Verify**:
   - Dialog closes
   - No changes saved
   - User list unchanged

## 📊 Console Debugging

You should see these logs in the browser console (F12):

### When Opening Edit Dialog:
```javascript
🔧 Opening edit dialog for user: {
  id: "USER0000000000001",
  name: "Admin User",
  email: "admin@demo.com",
  role: "admin",
  ...
}
```

### When Saving:
```javascript
💾 Saving user changes: {
  id: "USER0000000000001",
  original: {...},
  changes: {name: "Admin User - EDITED", hourlyRate: 150},
  sending: {
    id: "USER0000000000001",
    email: "admin@demo.com",
    passwordHash: "admin123",
    name: "Admin User - EDITED",
    role: "admin",
    hourlyRate: 150,
    ...
  }
}
```

### On Success:
```javascript
✅ User updated successfully
```

### On Error:
```javascript
❌ Failed to update user: Error message
```

## ⚠️ Known Backend Issue

The backend update endpoint (`PUT /api/users/{id}`) has some issues:
- Returns 500 Internal Server Error during testing
- Likely due to timestamp field handling or enum conversion
- The frontend code is correct and will work once backend is fixed

## 🔧 Testing Without Backend Fix

While backend has issues, you can still test:
1. ✅ Dialog opens/closes correctly
2. ✅ Form fields work and update
3. ✅ Lock/unlock functionality works
4. ✅ Edit button disables when locked
5. ✅ Validation works (empty fields, email format)
6. ✅ Loading states display correctly

The only part that won't work is the actual save to database until the backend issue is resolved.

## 🎯 Expected Behavior (Once Backend Fixed)

1. Click Edit → Dialog opens with user data
2. Modify fields → Changes tracked in form
3. Click Save → API call sent
4. Success → Dialog closes, list refreshes, database updated
5. Locked users → Cannot edit until unlocked

## 📝 Backend Fix Needed

The UserService.updateUser() method needs to handle partial updates properly:
- Merge new values with existing user
- Handle null/undefined fields correctly
- Don't require timestamps in the request
- Properly convert enum fields

Would you like me to fix the backend update method as well?
