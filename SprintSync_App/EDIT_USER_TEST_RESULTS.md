### Test 5: Backend Update Method ⚠️ NEEDS RESTART
**Status:** Compiled successfully but server needs restart
**Note:** Running server is using old code

## 🎯 How to Complete Testing

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server
**IMPORTANT:** The backend server is still running the old code!

Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C in the backend terminal) and restart:
```powershell
cd SprintSync_App_API
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Test in Browser
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to Admin Panel
3. Go to User Management tab
4. Open browser console (F12)

### Step 3: Test Lock/Unlock
1. Click 🔒 Lock button on any user
2. **Verify:**
   - Button changes to 🔓 Unlock (green)
   - "Locked" badge appears
   - Edit button is grayed out
   - Console: `🔒 User locked: USER...`

### Step 4: Verify Edit Button Disabled
1. With user locked, try clicking Edit button
2. **Verify:**
   - Button doesn't respond (disabled)
   - Tooltip shows "User is locked - unlock to edit"

### Step 5: Unlock and Edit
1. Click 🔓 Unlock button
2. Click ✏️ Edit button
3. **Verify:**
   - Dialog opens with user data
   - All fields pre-filled
   - Console: `🔧 Opening edit dialog for user: {...}`

### Step 6: Make Changes and Save
1. Change the name (e.g., add "- EDITED")
2. Change hourly rate (e.g., 120 → 150)
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. **Verify:**
   - Button shows "Saving..." with spinner
   - Console shows:
     ```
     💾 Saving user changes: {id, original, changes, sending}
     ```
   - Dialog closes
   - User list refreshes
   - Changes appear in the list
   - Console shows: `✅ User updated successfully`

### Step 7: Verify Persistence
1. Refresh the page (F5)
2. **Verify:**
   - Edited user still shows new values
   - Data was saved to database

## 🔍 Console Logs to Watch For

### Successful Edit Flow:
```javascript
🔧 Opening edit dialog for user: {id: "USER0000000000001", name: "Admin User", ...}
💾 Saving user changes: {
  id: "USER0000000000001",
  original: {name: "Admin User", hourlyRate: 120, ...},
  changes: {name: "Admin User - EDITED", hourlyRate: 150},
  sending: {complete user object with all fields}
}
✅ User updated successfully
```

### Lock/Unlock:
```javascript
🔒 User locked: USER0000000000001
🔓 User unlocked: USER0000000000001
```
