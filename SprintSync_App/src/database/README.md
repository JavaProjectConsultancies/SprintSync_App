│           └── Subtasks
```

- ✅ Project hierarchy (Projects → Sprints → Stories → Tasks → Subtasks)
- ✅ Time tracking and productivity monitoring
- ✅ Team allocation and resource management
- ✅ AI insights and analytics
- ✅ Milestone tracking
- ✅ Risk management
- ✅ Stakeholder management
- ✅ Integration with external tools
- ✅ Real-time notifications
- ✅ Commenting and collaboration
- ✅ File attachments
- ✅ Audit trails and activity logs
- ✅ Personal todo management
- ✅ Reporting and analytics

## Table Relationships

### Primary Relationships

1. **Users ↔ Projects**
   - Manager relationship: `projects.manager_id → users.id`
   - Team membership: `project_team_members` (many-to-many)

2. **Project Hierarchy**
   - `projects` → `sprints` → `stories` → `tasks` → `subtasks`

3. **Time Tracking**
   - Links to any level: project, story, task, or subtask
   - User-based tracking for productivity analysis

4. **Team Allocation**
   - `project_team_members` with allocation percentages
   - Role-based access through user roles

## Key Features Implementation

### Role-Based Access Control

```sql
-- 4 User Roles with specific permissions
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'manager', 'developer', 'designer');

-- Row Level Security policies ensure data isolation
-- Admins: Full access
-- Managers: See managed projects + team allocation
-- Developers/Designers: See assigned projects only
```

### Agile Methodology Support

```sql
-- Flexible methodology support
CREATE TYPE project_methodology AS ENUM ('scrum', 'kanban', 'waterfall');

-- Sprint management with velocity tracking
-- Story point estimation and burndown charts
-- Kanban board status tracking
```

### AI Insights Integration

```sql
-- AI-generated insights and recommendations
CREATE TYPE ai_insight_type AS ENUM (
    'productivity', 
    'risk_assessment', 
    'resource_optimization', 
    'timeline_prediction', 
    'quality_metrics'
);

-- Confidence scoring and expiration dates
-- JSON storage for flexible metrics and recommendations
```

### Time Tracking & Productivity

```sql
-- Granular time tracking at any hierarchy level
-- Multiple entry types (development, testing, design, meeting, etc.)
-- Billable hours tracking
-- Date/time range support for detailed analysis
```

### Real-time Notifications

```sql
-- Multi-type notification system
-- Priority levels and expiration dates
-- Entity linking for contextual notifications
-- Read/archive status tracking
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexes
- Comprehensive indexing on frequently queried columns
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Full-text search capabilities where needed

### Views
- Pre-computed views for common dashboard queries
- Sprint burndown analysis
- User workload metrics
- Project health indicators

### Triggers
- Automatic timestamp updates
- Project progress calculation
- Activity logging for audit trails

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Table-level security policies
- User context-based access control
- Role-based data filtering

### Audit Trail
- Complete activity logging
- Change tracking with old/new values
- User action attribution
- IP and user agent tracking

## Data Types and Constraints

### Enums for Data Integrity
- Status enums for consistent state management
- Priority levels across all entities
- Type classifications for better organization

### JSON Fields for Flexibility
- Skills arrays for users
- Configuration objects for integrations
- Metrics storage for AI insights
- Flexible metadata storage

## Database Setup

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL 12+ (for native JSON support and RLS)
- UUID extension enabled
- Proper user authentication system integration

### Initial Setup
```sql
-- Run the main schema file
\i schema.sql

-- Insert initial data (departments, domains, integrations)
-- Already included in schema.sql
```

### Configuration
```sql
-- Set application context for RLS
SET app.current_user_id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

## Integration Points

### External Tool Integrations
- GitHub/GitLab for version control
- Slack/Teams for communication
- Google Drive/OneDrive for file storage
- Jira/Confluence for existing tool migration

### API Considerations
- RESTful endpoints for all entities
- GraphQL support for complex queries
- Real-time WebSocket connections for notifications
- Bulk operations for data migration

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Partition strategies for time-series data (time_entries, activity_logs)
- Read replicas for reporting queries
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Data Archival
- Soft deletes with archive flags
- Historical data retention policies
- Compressed storage for old activity logs

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics Tables
